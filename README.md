# hermit

Yet another HTTP server built in Haskell (just for fun!)

## What is this?

*Hermit* is a personal project whose aim is to become a basic but functional HTTP server built in Haskell. It is **not** meant (at least for now) to become a production-ready server. My goal with *hermit* is to be able to learn / refresh my knowledge in areas such as computer networks, sockets, protocols and programming in Haskell.

## How to build?

You can use Haskell's [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) to build hermit after cloning the repo.

```bash
stack install
```
